## Overview of the Election Audit
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of canidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Determine each county and it total number of votes.
7. Calculate the percentage of the total vote each county recieved.
8. Determine the county with the largest number of voters.

Typically these tasks are performed in Excel, but Tom's manager wants to know if there's a way to automate the process using Python. If this audit is done successfully with Python, the code you and Tom write will be used to audit not only other congressional districts, but also senatorial districts and local elections.
